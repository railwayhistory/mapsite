# mapsite
The website for the railway history map.

The code is written in Javascript using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and [yarn2](https://yarnpkg.com/)
for package management.

To build the site run:

    yarn install
    yarn build

The website is then available in the `public/` directory.

If you want to run the site for development run:

    yarn dev

The development version will look at `http://localhost:8080` for the API.
